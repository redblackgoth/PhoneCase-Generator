The HaikaraWalker artbook gave a page with clean, full versions of these scripts. Like in other gamemodes, there are many background details in the Octo Expansion in which these scripts are used to write legible english (or in two cases I've found, romanized japanese) words. I already had a lot of notes I'd kept on these scripts, so I decided to make these into useable fonts.
Please note that Nintendo's use of these scripts is NOT 100% internally consistent (characters are often flipped or inconsistent (eg: 8 is often used for r),), gramatically or contextually correct (words are often truncated + misspelled. sentences such as "wedding portrait restration didital printing id passport video transfer fax copies" are used multiple times across various signs), nor always legible (you get the idea.) 

Also, please note that the means by which I made these fonts (scanned them in and vectorized them, assembled into fonts from scratch) means there is likely some degree of a quality drop. I don't have the means or time to completely assuage this, so hopefully it just won't be a problem.

Deepsea Stencil
Used heavily throughout the Deepsea Metro, notably on posters, signs, various interfaces, etc. Was able to solidly guess a corresponding letter to each character, with the exception of K and Q, which were guesses by elimination. O was not included in the page, as it's flipped from U, and so was re-added as it appears multiple times. Includes both a wider and less wide variant, which I took to assume as caps/lowercase. I don't think the game uses both types of cases in one sentence, so keep that in mind.
Note: this is missing one character that I've seen in a few places. I ommitted it because of not being included here, and being unable to find a corresponding letter.
Note: I also added a dash and a period, as these were used in a few places, and were easy to add.

Deepsea Triple
Used decoratively in a few places, notably in the back of kamabo tech interfaces, as well as on posters. Resembles Deepsea Stencil strongly, mostly same information as such.

Deepsea Line
Can't think of any specific examples in which this was used.
Letters mostly guessed based on resemblance to other scripts.

Deepsea Block and Deepsea Block Bold
Used decoratively on mostly signs and posters, as well as objects such as soda bottles.
Do not have a full set of 26 letters. I could only find corresponding matches with A, D, C, E, R, N, S, and U. I guessed with all the others. C was not included in the set in the artbook, but was rotated from another character. These fonts lack the letters (or at least, characters bound to the keys) F, J, K, Q, X, Y.

SPLATOON2 NEON
A readable English font with caps and lowercases. It's possible there might be higher quality versions ripped directly from the game out there, but I made this as a test before making the other ones. The only given punctuation was ! and ?. Not much to say about it.
